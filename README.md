Horiseon Digital Marketing
This project is the refactoring of  for "HoriSEOn" marketing agency 's existing website to improve its accessibility, organize its semantic structure in html, and consolidate properties in css.
This project consisted on three stages:
    1. Adding accessibility atributes to the head element (title, description, keywords) and alternative text to all images.
    2. Correcting the semantic html elements and eliminating unnecessary class and id atributes.
    3. Finally, the css stylesheet was simplified by consolidating redundancies (i.e. multiple elements with the same properties) and following the same organization as the semantic elements.
The result is code that is more efficient and friendly to other programmers, and a better-performing website, as the css was simplified.
